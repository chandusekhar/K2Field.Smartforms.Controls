K2 smartform controls!
======================

This solution has been created to pack and group smartform controls together and provide a easy way to install this 'smartform control pack'.
It's build to easily add controls to the solution, and for people to contribute their controls to the pack.

Some management and code-checking will be done by me (Ruben d'Arco) so we do get some quality and keep things working.

So, by all means, create a control, add it to this solution and make it easy to install it by others.
